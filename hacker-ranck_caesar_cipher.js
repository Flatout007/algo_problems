@description @namespace { 
    Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by 
encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter
by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of 
the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. 
In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.

Original alphabet:      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Alphabet rotated +3:    defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc
}

@example {
    The alphabet is rotated by , matching the mapping above. 
    The encrypted string is .

    Note: The cipher only encrypts letters; symbols, such as -, remain unencrypted.
    Function Description
    Complete the caesarCipher function in the editor below.
    caesarCipher has the following parameter(s):
    string s: cleartext
    int k: the alphabet rotation factor
    Returns
    string: the encrypted string
    Input Format
    The first line contains the integer, , the length of the unencrypted string.
    The second line contains the unencrypted string, .
    The third line contains , the number of letters to rotate the alphabet by.
