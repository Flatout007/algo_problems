    70. Climbing Stairs
    You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
    Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
 }
@example {
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps
